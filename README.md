# Poker Application

##What is this?
This is going to be a desktop java application for different poker games. The app will be developed in Java swing. This is a hobby project that i will be working on for my spare time. Feel free to contribute if you want!

##Current state
Currently the game consists of a menu where u can choose between BlackJack and Texas Hold'em.

BlackJack is a complete game with GUI. The game  got some restrictions though: you can't bet (simply play for score), you can only play 1 player vs the house.

Texas Hold'em is still just a prototype and not playable.

##Stuff to do
Blackjack:
Make betting possible (fake money), Maybe use multiple decks of cards?, Maybe create games for Texas Hold'em aswell and a menu where the User can choose between texas or blackjack, Allow multiple players?.

Texas:
Almost everything.
